# emuskel
a skeleton unicorn emulator implementation - used as a template for emulation projects.

# TODO

- [ ] implement the emulator and run with ELF + raw code
- [ ] implement various callbacks so the user can change these to specific needs
- [ ] implement a configuration file + parser: we want the user to be able to setup memory locations etc. in a config file
